      <h2>Artist Statement:</h2>
      <p>My work springs from the following concerns and ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The accumulation of memory through the imagery of geological sedimentation. The role of language in this process.</li>
        <li>Definitions of home and community, and the influence of landscape on identity.</li>
        <li>The containment of emotional processes so that they are visible but crystallised or fossilised.</li>
        <li>Tangible representations of how we now gather and filter information.</li>
        <li>Human attempts to control the uncontrollable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The media I use are handmade and reclaimed/recycled paper, traditional bookbinding materials, found objects, image transfer, various surface treatments and text.</p>
