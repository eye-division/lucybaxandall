Tidekettle has been a long time coming. I'll spare you the history, but after many wanderings, I'm home. Friends thought I had taken leave of my senses, probably because I couldn't coherently explain a move, along with my elderly mother, but often without my London-working partner, from my native Big Smoke to "isn't that in Scotland?" &nbsp;And maybe that's the point - I'm done explaining. I need to show, and to do, and let the paper speak.

Making and selling paper makes you a promoter and facilitator of other people's creativity. If you use it for your own artwork as well, be it drawings or artist's books, it can appear confusing unless you are in a 'book and paper arts' setting. It starts messing with that pesky boundary between art and craft. If you openly admit to making greetings cards (the horror!), no serious gallery will touch you with a bargepole. Well I'm sorry, but I don't accept that making art with serious intent behind it precludes moonlighting as one of Santa's elves. I just don't see these activities as mutually exclusive unless you are a straight-up snob. I was also growing weary of paying speculative entry fees and shipping for far-flung paper arts exhibitions, but needed to show my work. I need to share my joy in making with other people. I want them to leave feeling better than when they came in, inspired and energised to make something themselves. To make all that happen on a regular basis, a shop with a workspace was the answer, and that was never going to happen in London.&nbsp;

Berwick has been in my life since I was about four, so for 50 years, and is one of several past homes (and present ones for extended family) where a nearby border strongly informs the spirit of the place. Borderlands are of necessity outward-looking, always in motion, encouraging the mind to travel. When there is also a border with the restless North Sea to explore, the most jaded soul is rebooted. The creative community here is fabulous and friendly, and collaborations are already underway. Come and visit. Welcome to Berwick and to Tidekettle!
