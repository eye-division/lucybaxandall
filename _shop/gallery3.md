title: Papers
description_markdown: "The papers for sale here are limited editions, with the fibres harvested, cooked, beaten and the sheets handmade in small batches. Generous A4 size. They can be used for printmaking, collage, writing beautiful letters and making books. All are tub-sized and most are inkjet printable AT YOUR OWN RISK! While making no archival claims, we pH test at each stage to ensure all paper is the right side of neutral. We use cotton, linen and abaca base pulps along with seasonal plant materials and other intriguing inclusions. Prices per sheet unless specified."
