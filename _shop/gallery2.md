description_markdown: "Absorbent art? Porous poetry? Cutting edge coasters? It's up to you what you use these for, but they'll certainly start conversations among your guests. All pieces are on cotton paper handmade in our studio, handprinted with our own text using the linocut technique. Do get in touch through the contact page if you are interested in custom orders for special occasions."
