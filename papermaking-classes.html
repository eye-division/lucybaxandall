      <p>I currently teach at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.westdean.org.uk/">West Dean College</a>&nbsp;near Chichester; details of upcoming classes can be found at their website by searching under 'short courses' and 'papermaking'. I usually teach&nbsp;<em>Creative Papermaking -</em>&nbsp;<em>Translucency and Light</em>&nbsp;in January/February and&nbsp;<em>Creative Papermaking - Layer, Emboss and Cast&nbsp;</em>in June/July. If you are new to West Dean, take a look. The classes are like a retreat and a holiday as well as an intensive learning experience!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I also participate in community events close to Berwick and publicise those on Instagram @lucypaperbax&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I'm not currently taking bookings for other workshops as I'm taking some time to concentrate on my own work - more details on the Tidekettle news page.&nbsp;</p>
