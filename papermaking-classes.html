      <p>I currently teach at <a href="https://www.westdean.org.uk">West Dean College</a> near Chichester; details of upcoming classes can be found at their website by searching under 'papermaking'. I usually teach <em>Creative Papermaking -</em> <em>Translucency and Light</em> in January and <em>Creative Papermaking - Layer, Emboss and Cast&nbsp;</em>in July. If you are new to West Dean, take a look. The classes are like a retreat and a holiday as well as a learning experience!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Papermaking at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="www.morleycollege.ac.uk">Morley College</a> is back - check out&nbsp;<em>Fibre to Sketchbook, Papermaking - the Vessel&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Papermaking - Colour with Natural Dyes.</em></p>
      <p>Past teaching venues have included include the Summer School for the Association of Guilds of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers, East London Printmakers and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts at Birmingham University.</p>
      <p>I also teach friendly, individualised papermaking workshops at Tidekettle Paper in Berwick-upon-Tweed, for &nbsp;individuals and small groups of all ages. Options range from an Introduction to Papermaking for beginners to more specialised techniques, and project-based workshops.</p>
      <p>I have Qualified Teacher Status and welcome the opportunity to work with schools and other educational organisations. Details of past school workshops on request.</p>
      <p><strong>Papermaking Classes at Tidekettle in Berwick</strong></p>
      <p>* An Introduction to Papermaking</p>
      <p>2½-3 hours, all materials and paper included, £50 per person for 2 people, £75 for one person (for bookings taken from October 2023). I have reluctantly had to raise the individual price a little due to rising energy and materials costs. I can occasionally accommodate up to 4 people - just requires a bit more advance planning! The shop is wheelchair accessible.</p>
      <p>Please contact me to arrange a time that suits you - Sundays and Mondays are generally easiest as the shop is closed.</p>
      <p>Other options include Garden Plant Papermaking, Japanese Fibres and Sheet forming, various 3D techniques, Paper for Artists' Books, Paste Papers and special projects of your own. Prices will vary depending on time and materials required.</p>
      <p>To book, please contact me on here, Facebook, Instagram, drop into the shop or call/text 07528 217004.</p>
