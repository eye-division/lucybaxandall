    <p>I teach friendly, individualised papermaking workshops at my studio at Kingsgate Workshops Trust in London, for groups of up to four people of all ages; do send me a message via the contact page or the Facebook link above to discuss your requirements. Options range from an Introduction to Papermaking for beginners to more specialised areas, or even holiday card-making workshops.</p>


    <p>I have Qualified Teacher Status (in French and German!) and an enhanced DBS clearance, and welcome the opportunity to work with schools and other educational organisations. I recently completed a giant map project with the Southbank International Primary School in Hampstead - lots of pictures at the Facebook link above. </p>
