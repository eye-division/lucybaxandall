      <p>I currently teach at <a href="https://www.westdean.org.uk">West Dean College</a> near Chichester; details of upcoming classes can be found at their website by searching under 'papermaking'. The next class in late July 2021 is <a href="https://www.westdean.org.uk/study/short-courses/courses/s3d10868-creative-papermaking">here</a>. If you are new to West Dean, take a look. The classes are like a retreat and a holiday as well as a learning experience!&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Due to curriculum restructuring, papermaking classes at Morley College are being rested for 2021-22 but we hope very much to be back in Autumn 2022 with a full line-up of 2D and 3D options.</p>
      <p>I'll be working with Absolute Beginners (see news page) on their paper production phase in early July, and with children at <a href="https://atbirkhillhouse.co.uk/my-frame-of-mind-emerges/">Birkhill House</a>&nbsp;in mid July.</p>
      <p>Other teaching venues have included include the 2017 Summer School for the Association of Guilds of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers, East London Printmakers and the Barber Institute of Fine Arts at Birmingham University.</p>
      <p>I also teach friendly, individualised papermaking workshops at Tidekettle Paper in Berwick-upon-Tweed, for &nbsp;individuals and small groups of all ages.&nbsp;<strong>I'm currently taking bookings from August 2021 onwards.</strong>&nbsp;Options range from an Introduction to Papermaking for beginners to more specialised techniques, and project-based workshops.</p>
      <p>I have Qualified Teacher Status and welcome the opportunity to work with schools and other educational organisations. Details of past school workshops on request.</p>
      <p>Papermaking Classes at Tidekettle</p>
      <p>* An Introduction to Papermaking</p>
      <p>2 students, 2&frac12; hours, all materials and paper included, &pound;40 per person for 2 people, &pound;50 for one person (for bookings taken from 1/1/2020). I can occasionally accommodate up to 4 people - just requires a bit more advance planning! The shop is wheelchair accessible.</p>
      <p>Please contact me to arrange a time that suits you - Sundays and Mondays are generally easiest as the shop is closed.</p>
      <p>Other options include Garden Plant Papermaking, Japanese Fibres and Sheet forming, various 3D techniques, Paper for Artists' Books, Paste Papers and special projects of your own.</p>
      <p>To book, please contact me on here, Facebook, Instagam, drop into the shop or call/text 07528 217004.</p>
