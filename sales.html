      <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
      <h3>Prices</h3>
      <p>All prices are in Pounds Sterling. As we're a UK registered company, this makes our taxes a whole lot easier. If you wish to convert Pounds into your local currency the following website will give you an indication of equivalent price: <a href="http://www.xe.com/ucc/"><strong>xe currency convertor</strong></a></p>
      <h3>Stock</h3>
      <p>We only sell brand new products, not used items.</p>
      <p>Most products are carried in stock and can be dispatched quickly. &nbsp;We will try and keep you informed of the progress of your order. When an item is pre-ordered and money is taken for that item (as we use Paypal, this is standard), an expected shipping date will be communicated explicitly with the customer.</p>
      <h3>Delivery Time</h3>

      <h3>Cancellations</h3>
      <p>If you want to cancel your order, please notify us as soon as possible through the contact page. It may be that your order has already been dispatched so we are unable to stop it. We cannot guarantee to cancel items from an order.</p>
      <h3>Guarantees and Returns</h3>
