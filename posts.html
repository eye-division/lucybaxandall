 <div class="editable">
  <p>Regular studio updates, pictures and news are now on Facebook at <a href="http://www.facebook.com/lucybaxandallpaperwoman">Lucy Baxandall Paperwoman</a> (it's a public page so you don't need a Facebook account to view it, only if you want to like, comment or share). I also post frequent updates on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/LucyPaperBax">@LucyPaperBax</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lucypaperbax/">Instagram as Lucypaperbax</a>, so feel free to follow.</p>
  <p>You can join my mailing list via the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> for email updates at decent intervals.</p>
  <p>We can arrange a studio visit or customised workshop for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a very reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater.</p>

   <p>Lucy is available to teach papermaking and bookbinding workshops for adults and children by arrangement. Please use the <a href="/contact/">contact page</a> to discuss your requirements.</p>
