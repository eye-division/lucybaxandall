<p><strong>Forthcoming Events:</strong></p>

<p>Spring/Summer papermaking update time, and quite a busy one it is too!</p>


<p>On 27 May my fellow Morley College tutors and I will be offering outdoor taster workshops in 4 exciting media as part of the wonderful Chelsea Fringe Garden Festival:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/830720947080393/">https://www.facebook.com/events/830720947080393/</a> </p>

<p>On 4 June I’ll be teaching Introduction to Papermaking sessions at the West Dean Arts and Craft Festival at stunning West Dean College near Chichester:</p>

<p>Back to Morley College and 5 Fridays of Papermaking for Printmakers starting 9 June – though you don’t need to be a printmaker to enjoy this exploration of paper!</p>

<p>Much looking forward to Kingsgate Workshops Open Studios, which will be bigger and better than ever this year: 23-25 June. I’ll be leading tours and giving demonstrations as well as showing work.</p>

<p>Back to West Dean for an Introduction to Creative Papermaking course in July….</p>

<p>In August I’ll be teaching for Jane Ponsford at the Guild of Weavers, Spinners and Dyers Summer School, which is fully booked, but there is an Open Day on 19 August should you be in Winchester:</p>

<p>A new year of classes starts at Morley in September, more of that in the next update! </p>

<p>Meanwhile, a London Papermakers’ exhibition is in the early planning stages. We are currently exploring venues, so do let me know if you know of any galleries that might be interested in hosting a group show.</p>

<p>If you previously followed me on Instagram, my old account was strangely taken down by them for reasons that remain a mystery, but not to be deterred, I’ve started a new one! Links to that and Facebook page with regular updates in the top right corner.</p>

<p>Do get in touch any time using the contact page or Facebook. We can arrange a studio visit or customised workshop for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a very reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater.</strong></p>
