  <p>Late summer greetings to all.</p>
  <p>The Scottish schools are already back and the harvest is in so autumn can't be far away.</p>
  <p>I'm going to miss teaching at Morley College having passed the baton on to a new tutor after 9 years. Papermaking is still going strong there in the textiles department so do sign up if you are within reach of London - these days in adult education it's definitely use it or lose it!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The teaching side of things here in Berwick, at West Dean and elsewhere goes on as ever. I'm increasingly working with grant-funded artists which is great as it allows for longer, more in-depth workshops.&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Regular studio updates, pictures and news are now on Instagram and Facebook at Lucy at Tidekettle Paper: click on the links top right to take you straight there. I've deactivated my Twitter/X account as I used it less and was not enthused by the new regime!</p>
  <p>Do get in touch any time using the contact page, Instagram or Facebook. We can arrange customised workshops for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. <strong>NOW TAKING BOOKINGS FROM SPRING 2024.&nbsp;</strong>If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a &nbsp;reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater, do get in touch for details.</p>
  <h3>Collaborations, etc:</h3>
  <p>Exciting new project with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href="https://www.pithsupply.com/">Pith Supply</a> here in Berwick, more details soon.</p>
