  <p>26 November 2020</p>
  <p>With the news that Northumberland is in Tier 3 of the coronavirus restrictions, we'll be reopening&nbsp; on Wednesday 2 December along with lots of our Bridge Street neighbours. We hope to be open from 10-5 Tuesday to Saturday with some extra Sunday and Monday hours towards Christmas, but give us a shout first if you are making a special trip. While you are here, do support our cafes and pubs providing takeaway service. They have done an incredible job adapting to all the changes and we love them all!</p>
  <p>I've got a good selection of cards and prints from Emma Jones at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.weebluepress.com/">Wee Blue Press</a> which I can mail out so have a look at her website too.</p>
  <p>All being well, I'll be teaching at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.westdean.org.uk/study/tutors/lucy-baxandall">West Dean College</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.morleycollege.ac.uk/courses/course/papermaking-fibre-to-sketchbook/papermaking-fibre-to-sketchbook/">Morley College</a> in January 2021:</p>
  <p>2021 Classes at Morley College: Fibre to Sketchbook (January), Introduction to Papermaking 2 (March), 3D Vessels (May).</p>
  <p>2021 Class at West Dean College: Exploring Translucency (January) and&nbsp; Creative Papermaking in July 2021</p>
  <p>I'm not teaching in the shop as the space is a bit tight for safety, but I am taking provisional bookings for 2o21, both in the shop and at other venues. Should the virus intervene, a full refund is given in case of cancellation.</p>
  <p>Printmaker Sam Stokes (full disclosure: he's my son) has joined us recently and has got our little Adana letterpress up and running. He's also producing limited edition screen prints, which will soon be available online as well as in the shop.</p>
  <p>Regular studio updates, pictures and news are now on Instagram and Facebook at Lucy at Tidekettle Paper: click on the links top right to take you straight there. (it's a public page so you don't need a Facebook account to view it, only if you want to like, comment or share). I also post frequent updates on Twitter, so feel free to follow, link also above.</p>
  <p>You can join my mailing list via the contact page for email updates at decent intervals.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>Do get in touch any time using the contact page, Instagram or Facebook. We can arrange customised workshops for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a &nbsp;reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater.</p>
