  <p><strong>January 2024 - The winds of change are blowing at Tidekettle</strong></p>
  <p>Full disclosure: In 2022-3 I lost some things, namely my senses of taste and smell (over a year on from COVID and little change, so I’m assuming it’s permanent), a 40-year relationship and four stone in weight. I also gained some things: a constant high-pitched screaming in my ears and a daily more profound gratitude for my home, my health and my tribe.</p>
  <p>Time to go back to the source. I’m formally taking an at-home residency, length indefinite, to concentrate on the experimental papermaking and paper art that makes me want to get up in the morning.</p>
  <p>This means little to no routine production papermaking for now and very limited teaching. All existing orders, commissions, classes, workshops and collaborations, whether confirmed or in the discussion/planning stages, will absolutely be honoured, do get in touch if you have questions. I can still take bespoke paper orders, but the lead times will be longer and the prices higher than in the past.</p>
  <p>I will not be taking any new workshop bookings until further notice, and I strongly recommend the classes at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.westdean.ac.uk/?gad_source=1&amp;gclid=EAIaIQobChMItJn9soXsgwMVw0R_AB1HFAN2EAAYASAAEgKZf_D_BwE">West Dean College</a> for those able to commit to a three-day course.</p>
  <p>The shop/studio is open by appointment whenever I’m in Berwick - please text/WhatsApp 07528 217004, (I don’t answer calls from numbers outside my contact list) or fire me a message on the contact page, link above. Visitors are always most welcome and there is no pressure to buy.</p>
  <p>A thousand thanks to all who have supported and continue to support Tidekettle. New things are on the way, in their own good time.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some must conquer mountains</p>
  <p>Bag them, stand on top, bestride.</p>
  <p>Taunted by weather, they hunker, mutter, plot, and try again.</p>
  <p>As clouds scud by below them, punch the air.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Some prefer the journey down, the little caves, the mossy stones.</p>
  <p>They know the crust is thin and seek their refuge there,</p>
  <p>Among the boulders and the ferns</p>
  <p>Beneath the sheep-cropped grass with Mother Time.</p>
  <p> </p>
