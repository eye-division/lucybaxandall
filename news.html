  <p>Opening Hours</p>
  <p>Tidekettle is open from 11am-1pm and 3-5pm Tuesday to Friday. Occasionally we close for a teaching trip, including 15/11-18/11, but can always be contacted online.</p>
  <p>The rather extravagant-looking 2 hour lunch break is actually dog walking time for Lacey, our rescue lurcher, who would otherwise use her energy eating the paper in the shop. When family members are about to take on dog duties, we are open from 1-3 as well.</p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <p>Regular studio updates, pictures and news are now on Instagram and Facebook at Lucy at Tidekettle Paper: click on the links top right to take you straight there. (it's a public page so you don't need a Facebook account to view it, only if you want to like, comment or share). I also post frequent updates on Twitter, so feel free to follow, link also above.</p>
  <p>You can join my mailing list via the contact page for email updates at decent intervals.</p>
  <p><strong>Forthcoming Events:&nbsp;</strong></p>
  <p>2020 Classes at Morley College: Fibre to Sketchbook, Introduction to Papermaking, 3D Vessels.</p>
  <p>2020 Class at West Dean College: Exploring Translucency (January)</p>
  <p>Do get in touch any time using the contact page or Facebook. We can arrange customised workshops for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a &nbsp;reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater.</p>
