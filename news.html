  <p>3 January 2022</p>
  <p>A very Happy New Year to all from Berwick-upon-Tweed!&nbsp;</p>
  <p>The shop at 16 Bridge Street is open by appointment this month so we have time for some equipment maintenance and to make lots of lovely stuff for spring. All booked workshops are happening unless national advice changes. Please don't be shy to text or call 07528 217004 for a visit as you are always very welcome.</p>
  <p>I see there are only 2 places left on <a href="https://www.westdean.org.uk/study/short-courses/courses/slw11349-creative-papermaking">our next course at West Dean</a>&nbsp;on 21-24 January so don't miss out if you have always wanted to work with translucent paper. Three days of&nbsp; 2D and 3D paper adventures in a beautiful setting will set you up for the year! I'm really looking forward to it.</p>
  <p>At around the same time, our <a href="https://www.crowood.com/products/papermaking-by-lucy-baxandall?_pos=1&amp;_psq=papermaking&amp;_ss=e&amp;_v=1.0">new how-to papermaking book</a>&nbsp;will appear with the Crowood Press, illustrated with photos by the wonderful <a href="https://www.sineadkempley.com/">Sin&eacute;ad Kempley</a>. As soon as it's available we'll have it here in the website shop - very exciting!</p>
  <p>Papermaking classes at Morley College are taking a break this year but we hope to be back in the autumn and you'll be the first to know all the new class dates.</p>
  <p>The most regular studio updates, pictures and news are now on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter at Lucy at Tidekettle Paper: click on the links top right to take you straight there. (they are public pages so you don't need a Facebook account to view them, only if you want to like, comment or share).&nbsp;</p>
  <p>You can join my mailing list via the contact page for email updates at decent intervals, though I'm rather bad at producing newsletters - new year's resolution to remedy that.</p>
  <p>Do get in touch any time using the contact page, Instagram or Facebook. We can arrange customised workshops for up to four people, adults or children - anything from an introduction to papermaking to more specialised areas. If you are an artist or student who wishes to incorporate handmade paper into a project, I would be happy to help. I also provide a &nbsp;reasonably-priced fibre processing service if you don't have access to a beater.</p>
  <h3>Collaborations, etc:</h3>
  <p>I have a little papermaking story on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.morleycollege.ac.uk/news/2218_papermaking_me">Morley College website</a>!</p>
